          <p>
            OTAKU started with one idea: anime isn’t just something you watch—it’s something you wear. We make streetwear and merch that’s built for fans: bold prints, clean cuts, and gear that actually holds up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our drops are inspired by the shows and characters we love, plus original designs that fit the culture. We care about quality fabric, sharp graphics, and pieces you’ll want to wear every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether you’re repping your favorite series or just want gear that looks good, OTAKU is here for the community. Thanks for being part of it.
